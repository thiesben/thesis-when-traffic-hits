# When Traffic Hits: A geospatial Big Data Analysis of Berlin's Road Network with Applications

In this repository you'll find my Master's thesis as submitted to the School of Business and Economics of the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (Humboldt University Berlin) along with Jupyter Notebooks I used to analyse the data and create all the figures.

Since the Data is proprietary, I am unfortunately not allowed to share it, therefore the code will not be executable unless you have other data for substitution.
